# Audio-Classification

* Downloaded dataset from https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html 

* Built a tool that classify urban sound from 10 classes: air conditioner, car horn, children playing, dog bark, drilling, engin2, gun shot, jackhammer, siren, and street music 

* Converged audio signal to mono channel and converted it to normalized features using Librosa package (Mel - Frequency Cepstral Coefficient) 

* Trained an ANN model with hyperparameter tuning to get validation accuracy of 0.80
